ðŸ«€ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Heart Attack Prediction
Exploratory Data Analysis is the process of:
Understanding the data distribution
Detecting outliers or anomalies
Identifying missing values
Exploring relationships between variables
Gaining insights that guide feature engineering and model selection


# ðŸ«€ Heart Attack Prediction Dataset

This dataset contains medical attributes of patients used to analyze and predict the likelihood of a heart attack.  
Each feature provides clinical or demographic information relevant to cardiovascular health.

## ðŸ“‹ Dataset Features

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **age** | Age of the patient |
| **sex** | Gender (1 = male, 0 = female) |
| **cp** | Chest pain type (0â€“3, representing different categories) |
| **trestbps** | Resting blood pressure (mm Hg) |
| **chol** | Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl) |
| **fbs** | Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dl: 1 = true, 0 = false) |
| **restecg** | Resting electrocardiographic results |
| **thalach** | Maximum heart rate achieved |
| **exang** | Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no) |
| **oldpeak** | ST depression induced by exercise |
| **slope** | Slope of the peak exercise ST segment |
| **ca** | Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0â€“3) |
| **thal** | Thalassemia type (normal, fixed defect, reversible defect) |
| **target** | Heart attack risk (1 = likely, 0 = unlikely) |

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The purpose of this dataset is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and develop models that can identify patients at high risk of heart attack based on their medical history and health indicators.
